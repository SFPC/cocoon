How do I apply?
Application link and deadline
We will be accepting up to 18 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within 5 days of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!​
How much is tuition?
$750 + Withfriends payment processing fees for five weekly classes. Upon payment, your space in the class will be reserved.
We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. While we price our classes reasonably to offer quality learning experiences, we understand the tuition is beyond the reach of many people. We are sensitive to the rapidly changing economy due to the COVID-19. While we can’t offer scholarships like the past, we hope to support students in need. Our previous students have received support from cultural foundations, schools, current employers, or crowdfunding. We are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance. Please check out these resources for financial support in response to the COVID19 pandemic.
Cloud9 Mutual Aid Doc: Financial Assistance
The Art of Social Distancing We are committed to being transparent about how we make and spend money. In the spirit of radical openness and generosity, on which the school was founded, we open-source our finances on Github. There, you can read financial reports and download raw statements.
What if I can’t go, can I get a refund?
Yes, we can give you 100% refund up to 10 days before class starts
50% refund after 10 days, until the first day of class
No refunds can be given after the first day of class
Accessibility
Our classes are conducted in spoken English with audiovisual materials such as slides, code examples and video. All classes will be held over Zoom. Please contact us with special accessibility requests.
If you have any questions regarding the class, please email info@sfpc.io.

                    The School for Poetic Computation is changing. This summer, we are making a temporary space together: a <span class="cocoon-inline">COCOON</span>. We invite you into our collective studies as we work towards an experimental curriculum
                    that can grow and transform over time. We will learn to unlearn with others in order to change the conditions of learning itself. We are making new “schooling” formations that facilitate the oscillation between “teacher" and “student."
                    Not yet flying, we invite you to wrap yourselves in the warm, gooey muck of becoming – in the shedding and secreting, all over again.

                </p>

                <p>
                    What does this chrysalis body-space do for us, as learners? What can it help us unlearn? What protection does it give, what vulnerability does it keep? And, if we're faithful to the image, what is it we're hardening around ourselves? Are we in the cocoon
                    together? Do we each make our cocoon after we depart?
