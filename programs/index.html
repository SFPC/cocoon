                          <p id="descriptionText">
                            In this workshop, participants will study both history of math -- including some connections to computing, ecology, politics, religion, and literature -- and practices of learning/using/creating math. Topics certain for at least brief discussion with everyone include a whirlwind survey of mathematics in a few pre-colonial societies and in the contemporary field, varieties of infinity, math education, logic, cultural and linguistic specificity of mathematics, category theory, and the physical realization of abstract computational models. Possible topics for discussion with everyone or in smaller groups according to participant interest include greater elaboration of the previously named topics, and other branches of mathematics or closely linked fields such as probability theory, programming language theory, computational complexity theory, information theory, music theory, graph/network theory, order theory, Ramsey theory, approximation theory, geometry, and fractals. There will be no assumption of mathematics knowledge more advanced than a vague recollection of middle/high school algebra, nor unrealistic expectations of building expertise in little more than a month's time; the intention for the short course is to build interest in and appreciation for a diverse and beautiful subject too often uglified by elitism, prejudice, and excessive rigidity.

                            We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. While we price our classes reasonably to offer quality learning experiences, we understand the tuition is beyond the reach of many people. We are sensitive to the rapidly changing economy due to the COVID-19. While we can’t offer scholarships like the past, we hope to support students in need. Our previous students have received support from cultural foundations, schools, current employers, or crowdfunding. We are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance. Please check out these resources for financial support in response to the COVID19 pandemic.

                          The School for Poetic Computation is changing.
                          This summer, we are making a temporary space together in a <span class="cocoon-inline">COCOON</span>. We invite you into our collective studies as we work towards an experimental curriculum that can grow and transform over time. We will learn to unlearn with others in order to change the conditions of learning itself. We are making new schooling formations that facilitate the oscillation between teacher and student. Not yet flying, we invite you to wrap yourselves in the warm, gooey muck of becoming in the shedding over and over again.


                      </p>
