            are making a temporary space together: a cocoon. We invite you into our collective studies as we work towards an experimental curriculum that can grow and transform over time. We will learn to unlearn with others in order to change the conditions of learning itself. We are making new “schooling” formations that facilitate the oscillation between “teacher" and “student." Not yet flying, we invite you to think with us in the warm muck of becoming, the shedding, and becoming all over again.
