          The School for Poetic Computation is changing. This summer, we are making a temporary space together—inviting others into our (un)learning and into our collective studies. In the process, we are developing experimental curriculum that can later grow and morph to be taught again and again. Unlearning is a process of learning to unlearn with others in order to change the conditions of learning itself. We are seeking new “schooling” positions that facilitate the oscillation between “teacher" and “learner." How do we go into the cocoon, again, and how do we leave it behind?
