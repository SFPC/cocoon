                    The School for Poetic Computation is changing.
                    This summer, we are making a temporary space together in a <span class="cocoon-inline">COCOON</span>. We invite you into our collective studies as we work towards an experimental curriculum that can grow and transform over time. We will learn to unlearn with others in order to change the conditions of learning itself. We are making new schooling formations that facilitate the oscillation between teacher and student. Not yet flying, we invite you to wrap yourselves in the warm, gooey muck of becoming in the shedding over and over again.


                </p>

                <p>
                  What does this chrysalis body space do for us as learners? What can it help us unlearn? What protection does it give? What vulnerability does it keep? And, if we're faithful to the image, what is it we're surfacing around ourselves? Are we in the cocoon together? Do we each make our cocoon after we depart?
