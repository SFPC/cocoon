                    The School for Poetic Computation is changing. This summer, we are making a temporary space together: a <span class="cocoon-inline">COCOON</span>. We invite you into our collective studies as we work towards an experimental curriculum
                    that can grow and transform over time. We will learn to unlearn with others in order to change the conditions of learning itself. We are making new “schooling” formations that facilitate the oscillation between “teacher" and “student."
                    Not yet flying, we invite you to wrap yourselves in the warm, gooey muck of becoming – in the shedding and secreting, all over again.

                </p>

                <p>
                    What does this chrysalis body-space do for us, as learners? What can it help us unlearn? What protection does it give, what vulnerability does it keep? And, if we're faithful to the image, what is it we're hardening around ourselves? Are we in the cocoon
                    together? Do we each make our cocoon after we depart?
